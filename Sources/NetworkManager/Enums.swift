/*
 GET:
 Used to retrieve data from the server. It should not alter the state of the server. Example: fetching a list of products or a specific user's details.
 
 POST:
 Used to create a new resource on the server. Data is sent in the request body. Example: adding a new product to an e-commerce store or submitting a form.
 
 PUT:
 Used to update an existing resource or create a new resource if it doesn't exist, by replacing the entire resource with the provided data. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical PUT requests have the same effect. Example: updating all fields of a user's profile.
 
 PATCH:
 Used to partially update an existing resource. Only the specified fields in the request body are modified, leaving other fields untouched. Example: updating only a user's email address.
 
 DELETE:
 Used to remove a resource from the server. Example: deleting a specific product or user account.
